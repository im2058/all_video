00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
[Captions by Y Translator]
We've got a really cool project
coming up for you today.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,800
Today's video is
sponsored by Casper.

3
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:05,200
They make fantastic mattresses,

4
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:06,600
and I thought if we're going
to have a great mattress,

5
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:08,400
we should have something
great to put it on.

6
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:11,000
So today we are building
the world's coolest bed frame.

7
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,922
This is not your
ordinary bed frame.

8
00:00:12,962 --> 00:00:13,400
Trust me.

9
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:14,300
It's going to be amazing.

10
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:18,460
[Music]

11
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:19,700
We've got all our supplies.

12
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:20,400
You've got a bunch of tools.

13
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:21,312
So it's time to get started,

14
00:00:21,312 --> 00:00:23,700
and the first thing I
actually did was to draw

15
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:25,600
the whole frame on SketchUp.

16
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,300
This is something I'm going
to use as a reference

17
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:29,662
to make sure I'm getting all
the right number of pieces,

18
00:00:29,662 --> 00:00:30,500
and the right sizes,

19
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:32,300
and the right shapes,
and all of that good stuff.

20
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:32,900
But for now,

21
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:35,380
I think what we need to do is
take some of these 4x4,

22
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:36,800
and cut them down to size.

23
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:44,120
[Music]

24
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:44,860
At Home Depot,

25
00:00:44,862 --> 00:00:47,100
I requested that they cut
these boards to 23 inches,

26
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:48,400
and they were pretty close.

27
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:51,500
I got 1/8 of an inch
under 23 inches.

28
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:52,900
That's why I measure to make sure

29
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:55,322
so I don't end up
with these posts being too long.

30
00:00:55,822 --> 00:00:58,600
So now, we're going to measure
just under 23 inch segments,

31
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,892
and cut those off
of our 4x4 beams.

32
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:05,640
[Music]

33
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:06,860
Beautiful.

34
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:08,020
Perfect fit.

35
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:40,340
[Music]

36
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:43,460
Now, you can see the very
beginning of what we're going for.

37
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:44,900
The box is definitely
not finished.

38
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:46,600
But this will be one
of the front pieces,

39
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:48,000
that will be near the back.

40
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,240
There's actually going to be
an extension beyond this.

41
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,200
But this is the size

42
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,000
of the storage
that we're going to have inside.

43
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,700
Next, I'm also going to cut
a piece that goes right along

44
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:58,225
in between these two 4x4 posts,

45
00:01:58,505 --> 00:01:59,600
that will divide it
right in the middle,

46
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,900
and offer support
down the middle of the bed.

47
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:05,772
You've seen that I used a lot
of screws to attach the 4x4

48
00:02:05,772 --> 00:02:08,800
to these boards here
these ones do not have that,

49
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,800
and although there
will be a 4x4 beam

50
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,200
about in the middle on this,

51
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,300
what I'm going to do

52
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:15,900
to attach it to these is
drill holes all the way through,

53
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:17,300
and use some carriage bolts,

54
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:20,500
and that will give a really
strong connection to the post,

55
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:22,300
which will make it
so there's no play,

56
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:23,000
there's no wobble,

57
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,100
but it also makes it

58
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:26,800
so I can easily take it apart
when I need to move this.

59
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:30,600
This piece here can fit through
pretty much any door frame,

60
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:32,200
and through any hallway
that I need.

61
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:34,100
The whole bed
in its entirety can't,

62
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:36,200
but it should easily
dismantled down into pieces,

63
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,022
that I can carry or move.

64
00:02:39,212 --> 00:02:40,400
After discussing it
with a friend of mine

65
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,100
who's an electrician,

66
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:43,440
I started working on the
electrical portions of the bed.

67
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:44,700
This thing is going
to have lights,

68
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:47,032
electricity, speakers,
the whole works.

69
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:55,420
[Music]

70
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:06,620
Two hours later.

71
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:22,220
[Music]

72
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:24,760
The main frame of the bed
is now assembled.

73
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:27,940
We've got all of the stuff
to install into the headboard,

74
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:29,100
but I think at this point,

75
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:30,800
I'm going to throw
the mattress on,

76
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,562
but it's time for the unveil.

77
00:03:33,492 --> 00:03:35,600
I have been using it Casper
mattress for several months now,

78
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,200
and I love it.

79
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,500
It's got like layers,

80
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,400
of different densities
of foam to give,

81
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,600
like just the right balance
between bouncy and soft.

82
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,300
So there's like
no pressure points and stuff.

83
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,100
It is a super great mattress.

84
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:48,300
I definitely love it.

85
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:49,800
Guys, if you're doing
what you're supposed to,

86
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:52,700
you should be spending 1/3
of your life asleep in bed,

87
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,580
getting 8 hours of sleep.

88
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:55,600
So you want to make sure

89
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:58,200
that you spend that time well
and be comfortable.

90
00:03:58,500 --> 00:03:59,400
I also really appreciate

91
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,200
how convenient they
make it to order.

92
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,700
It comes delivered straight
to your door in a box

93
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:04,800
that's surprisingly small.

94
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:05,500
You're not really sure

95
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:07,640
how they squished it
mattress down like that,

96
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:11,300
and you get a 100 night
sleep on it trial.

97
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:14,200
So you actually get
to you it for like 3 months.

98
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:17,000
If after your 100-day trial
you decide it's not for you,

99
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,192
they have hassle-free returns,

100
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,300
shipping to you

101
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:21,900
and returning it is free,
if you're in the US and Canada.

102
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,200
If you want to get your own very
cool, super comfortable mattress,

103
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:27,800
head over to
Casper.com/TheKingofRandom,

104
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:30,400
and use promo code,
thekingofrandom to get 50 bucks,

105
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,902
off of selected mattresses.

106
00:04:32,912 --> 00:04:34,700
Guys, the bed is done.

107
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:36,700
This has been a crazy big,

108
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:39,000
very fancy,
very complicated build.

109
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,800
But I am very excited
to have it all finished,

110
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,720
and to show you what it can do.

111
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,600
First off,
its a king-size mattress,

112
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,400
and you can see
that there's space on it.

113
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,700
In fact, if you look
underneath the bed cover,

114
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:50,900
there's actually just
a little bit of extra space

115
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:51,900
going all the way around,

116
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:53,240
and that was intentional.

117
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,600
I am quite tall.

118
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,400
I can quite easily
get into this bed

119
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,500
without any effort,

120
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:00,472
but a shorter person may want
something to put a knee on

121
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:02,920
as they climb up into the bed
or something like that.

122
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,400
So there is just a little bit

123
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,900
of a border going all the way,
around on the end here

124
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:09,940
that also works to help
lift up and down.

125
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:12,600
Now, the whole point
of this box shape,

126
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,600
and everything, was

127
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,000
that there's storage
underneath it.

128
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,362
And we have a 6 foot wide,
6 foot long,

129
00:05:17,362 --> 00:05:20,800
2 foot tall storage room
underneath this bed.

130
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,700
Because it does have
the two gas struts installed,

131
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:27,000
it lifts up pretty easily even
with the mattress on top of it.

132
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,340
You can see I've got a lot
of space down there.

133
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:32,160
You can throw whatever you want.

134
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:34,000
It's going to be well
protected, well secured,

135
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,700
and you're not going to have
to worry about whether

136
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:37,800
this platform is going
to collapse onto it or anything,

137
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,442
because it is super sturdy.

138
00:05:39,692 --> 00:05:41,900
Overall, this thing is strong,

139
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:44,600
and has just a lot
of space underneath it.

140
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,200
I've got some lights,

141
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:49,000
just in case you need
more visibility down in there.

142
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,200
There's actually not a lot
of need for it.

143
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:51,900
You can see on this side.

144
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:54,100
You can look all the way
into the back of it,

145
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:56,862
and you have pretty
good lighting but just in case.

146
00:05:57,342 --> 00:05:57,900
You can see I've got

147
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:59,400
LED strip lighting going
all the way around.

148
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,532
Let's take a closer look at
how that's being installed.

149
00:06:01,912 --> 00:06:03,200
Plugged into a power strip

150
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,192
that I will show
you in a minute.

151
00:06:04,192 --> 00:06:06,300
It's just an LED control box,

152
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:08,720
that's got some wires
that come over to here.

153
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:12,100
This right here is the IR
receiver for the remote control.

154
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:13,400
This was just a role

155
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,600
of strip lighting
that I bought online.

156
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,700
It didn't come
in these plastic sheets.

157
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:18,780
So I actually bought
the track as well.

158
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:19,700
So I installed the track,

159
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:21,600
and then I installed
the lighting inside that.

160
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:25,100
I had to solder in a little bit
of wire as a joint,

161
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:27,500
so it would be able
to go around the hinge

162
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:28,600
when I open the bed,

163
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,400
and then of course,

164
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,900
goes back into
more track lighting.

165
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:33,920
So this goes all the way
around to the other side.

166
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,400
Let's take a look at it
with the lights off,

167
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,382
because it looks pretty cool.

168
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,612
Beautiful under lighting.

169
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:40,300
It's very fun.

170
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,100
All sorts of colors.

171
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:43,600
It comes pre-programmed

172
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,600
in the remote with a whole bunch
of different colors.

173
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,700
I actually often like to use red
before I'm going to sleep.

174
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:50,812
It makes it easier
for you to fall asleep,

175
00:06:51,192 --> 00:06:54,200
blue lighting is going to keep
you awake a little bit more.

176
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,900
But if you're not trying
to go to sleep,

177
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:58,512
then it has just so many colors.

178
00:06:59,132 --> 00:07:00,500
Party room!
What!

179
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:02,200
While I've got the lights off,

180
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:04,072
I can show you
another handy little thing.

181
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:09,680
It's got these two gooseneck
lamps that I can turn on.

182
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,700
These are just nice
little reading lights.

183
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:12,900
You can control it
from one side.

184
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:15,240
If you find
that it's too bright,

185
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:17,000
they're actually
dimmable as well.

186
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,400
So if I just hold
my finger on it,

187
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,300
it can get brighter.

188
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,800
Tap it again and hold,
and it gets dimmer.

189
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:24,900
Both sides of the bed have
an outlet with two plugs

190
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:26,120
and 2 USB ports.

191
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:28,100
It's very convenient for
anything you may want to charge

192
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:29,400
or leave plugged in on your bed.

193
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,400
We've also gone ahead,

194
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,500
and included some cup
holders on each side.

195
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:33,800
Sometimes, you just get thirsty.

196
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:37,900
It holds it really nicely,

197
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:40,000
and the cup holders
are collapsible.

198
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:40,900
So if you've got nothing

199
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:42,700
in there, you don't have
to worry about accidentally

200
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:44,500
bumping into it as you get
in and out of the bed.

201
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,000
I also have a couple

202
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,100
of speakers built
into both sides of the bed,

203
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:49,700
and the controls are built

204
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:51,420
into the center
of the headboard here.

205
00:07:51,420 --> 00:08:11,200
[Music]

206
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,500
The speakers are set up so you
can either use an aux cord,

207
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:15,300
or you can just run it
all through Bluetooth.

208
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:20,500
[Music]

209
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:21,600
Casper foam mattresses.

210
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,800
They sleep pretty cool.

211
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,700
You don't tend
to over heat in them,

212
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:25,700
like you doing some kinds.

213
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:29,200
I however actually tend
to run fairly cool anyway,

214
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:32,500
which means that I like
a little bit more heat.

215
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:36,600
So what I've done is I just have
a heated blanket all over my bed

216
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,060
underneath the cover,

217
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:42,000
and the control for that just
sits right here next to my head.

218
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:44,300
The cord is running
under the mattress to here,

219
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:46,600
and then the power
cord comes down.

220
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,300
I have two power
outlets on the top.

221
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:51,400
But I've also added power outlets
on the inside of the legs here.

222
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:54,000
This is partly
because I've covered

223
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,100
up the outlet in the middle
of the wall behind the bed,

224
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:57,400
and I didn't want to make it

225
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,500
so you can't use it anymore.

226
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,600
So I've wired both of these,

227
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:03,200
there's one on each side,
into that center outlet,

228
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,400
and so we still have power.

229
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:06,200
You know, if you're vacuuming
the room or something like that,

230
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,200
you need to be able
to plug stuff in.

231
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,100
Or if you have a heated
blanket on your bed,

232
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:10,700
you need to be able
to plug it in somewhere.

233
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,700
That's why I've also added
some outlets here,

234
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:14,300
and I did put them on the inside

235
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:16,000
so that they
aren't really obtrusive.

236
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:16,500
They don't get in the way.

237
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:17,400
You don't see them too much,

238
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,000
but they are there
when you need them.

239
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:22,840
I've added 4 workbench casters
on to the bed.

240
00:09:22,842 --> 00:09:24,200
2 here in the back,

241
00:09:24,242 --> 00:09:26,672
and 2 on the inside
of the storage box.

242
00:09:27,432 --> 00:09:28,900
Workbench casters are the type

243
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:32,100
where the wheel is actually
not in contact with the ground.

244
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:34,500
It looks like it is because of
this carpet is pretty thick,

245
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,992
but the wheel is not in
contact with the ground

246
00:09:37,342 --> 00:09:38,582
until we engage it.

247
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:41,272
When we do that,
the wheel engages,

248
00:09:41,272 --> 00:09:43,902
and it actually lifts up
the frame that it's on.

249
00:09:44,712 --> 00:09:46,652
With all 4 casters engaged,

250
00:09:46,652 --> 00:09:49,232
tt's possible to actually just
roll the bed a little bit.

251
00:09:49,232 --> 00:09:52,300
It's not a great system
because it is on carpet,

252
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:53,400
and it's still
really big and heavy,

253
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:54,980
but it's a lot easier

254
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:57,000
than if you didn't have
those on there.

255
00:09:59,532 --> 00:10:00,900
With that pulled out,
we can also take a look

256
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:02,500
behind the bed and see
what's going on.

257
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:04,900
Here are the plugs,

258
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:07,700
and you can see
that this outlet would really be

259
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:09,400
pretty inaccessible
for behind this bed.

260
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:12,100
So what I've done is I've set
up everything to be wired

261
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:13,460
into the bed itself.

262
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:15,800
One plug is coming
into this big old power strip

263
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:18,300
that I have attached with
these two makeshift brackets,

264
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:20,500
and most everything
plugs into that.

265
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:23,100
We've got our to bed
lights plug into that.

266
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:25,540
We've got our speaker system
plugged into that,

267
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:27,800
and we have the under
lighting all plugged

268
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:28,600
into this power strip.

269
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,100
The other plug is

270
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:32,400
what's powering the 4
outlets going around.

271
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:35,000
The outlets aren't on the same
circuit as the speakers,

272
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,612
the lights, and under lighting.

273
00:10:37,172 --> 00:10:38,400
They have their own circuit,

274
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:41,200
and it just goes
all the way around.

275
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,000
So the 4 are on one circuit.

276
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:43,700
Obviously,

277
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:45,992
I can't run too much power
out of all of them at once,

278
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,400
but they're mostly for things
like the electric blanket,

279
00:10:48,622 --> 00:10:51,512
or charging my laptop overnight.

280
00:10:51,512 --> 00:10:53,000
You can also see
I've got a little piece

281
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,000
of foam right here.

282
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,200
This is a furniture slider,

283
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,100
and it's just to make sure

284
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:58,600
that if the bed does touch
the wall itself,

285
00:10:58,600 --> 00:10:59,900
it's not going to I
should have too much.

286
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:01,680
Quick note about the bed frame,

287
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:04,300
first off, thanks to my friend Travis for
helping me come up with a design.

288
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:07,300
Second, if you are interested
in building one of these for yourself,

289
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:10,600
I have posted
the SketchUp file design

290
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:12,400
of this bed in description
for the video.

291
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,700
It doesn't have instructions
on how to build it.

292
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:16,100
It just shows you
all the pieces,

293
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:17,140
and where they go.

294
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,400
You will have to do a little bit

295
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,200
of figuring out of how to
attach everything yourself.

296
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:22,900
Thanks again to Casper,
for sponsoring this video.

297
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:25,200
